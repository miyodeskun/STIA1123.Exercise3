The output will be the sum of random number from a range of 0-40 and 10.

# Question 5
    Determine the output of the following code segments:
    String test = "abc";
    test = test + test;

Output: abcabc

    Random random = new Random();
    double d = Math.round ( 2.5 + random.nextInt(1) );
    System.out.println("The value is ‚Äù + d);
Ouput: The value is 3.0
